Hello ðŸ‘‹ This is one of my biggest project yet, i've been working on it for quite a while

This project is about web building web app that is integrated in SAAS architecture

Features that i've worked on include:
- Building payment infrastructure with MIDTRANS
- Creating subscription/recurring billing system with MIDTRANS
- Debug delete element in state management
- Create drag and drop features for every element
- Create a compiler for the static website that has been made in 3 different formats (React, HTML, CSS) so that its possible to download the file
- Create keyboard shortcuts for editing and building process
- Layers tab on the sidebar of the editors, so that its possible to see the layer of the element
- Create copy paste features for the colors

If you want to reproduce the web application you need:
1. MySQL connections 
2. Clerk accounts and api keys
3. MIDTRANS and its api keys
4. UploadThing and its api keys
5. Initialize ShadCN UI in the environment
